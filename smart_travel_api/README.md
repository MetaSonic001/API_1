# Smart Travel API

An open-source, AI-powered backend service designed to revolutionize personalized travel planning.

## Overview

The Smart Travel API acts as the intelligent core for travel applications, enabling users to create dynamic, end-to-end trip itineraries tailored to their budgets, interests, preferences, and real-time conditions. Built with a multi-agent AI system, it leverages lightweight Hugging Face models to collaborate on tasks like destination exploration, transport planning, budget optimization, and immersive audio tours.

### Purpose

This API solves common pain points in travel planning:
- Static recommendations
- Manual adjustments for weather/delays  
- Fragmented booking experiences

It provides a seamless, adaptive solution where AI agents work together to generate hyper-personalized plans that evolve with user inputs and external factors.

**Target Users:** Mobile/web apps for individual travelers, families, or groups  
**Focus:** Accessibility, safety, and immersion  
**Architecture:** Fully extensible for production use

> **Note:** This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation, focusing on core functionality while leaving room for enhancements like full-scale bookings or advanced social features.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Personalized Itinerary Generation
- Creates day-by-day plans including activities, transport, accommodations, dining, and costs
- Tailors to user budgets, interests, and vibes via moodboard analysis
- Exports plans as iCal (.ics) for easy calendar integration

### ðŸŽ¤ Multimodal Input Support
- **Voice Prompts:** Transcribe spoken inputs using Whisper
- **Moodboard/Image Interpretation:** Analyze uploaded images with CLIP to detect vibes
- **Calendar Integration:** Parse .ics files to identify free dates
- **Quick Modes:** "Surprise Me" and "Follow My Feet" for instant planning

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic Replanning
- Monitors real-time conditions (weather via Open-Meteo)
- Automatically triggers itinerary adjustments
- Uses event bus to handle delays, closures, or cancellations

### ðŸŽ§ Immersive Audio Tours
- Generates detailed, conversational tour narratives
- Includes TTS audio output as base64-encoded WAV files
- Specialist agents ensure focused content (culinary, historical, etc.)

### ðŸ“± Bookings and Utilities
- **Mock Bookings:** Fetches real availability/pricing from OpenTripMap
- **Safety & Accessibility:** Provides advisories and wheelchair-friendly routes
- **Fact Verification:** Checks historical/architectural facts with citations
- **POI Search:** Semantic search in Qdrant vector DB

### ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Recommendations
- POIs scraped dynamically and stored in Qdrant for fast retrieval
- Supports real-time web data via duckduckgo-search and Playwright

## Advantages

âœ… **Personalization at Scale:** Multi-agent collaboration ensures deeply tailored plans  
âœ… **Dynamic & Adaptive:** Real-time replanning makes it resilient to changes  
âœ… **Multimodal & User-Friendly:** Supports creative inputs (voice, images, calendars)  
âœ… **Immersive Experiences:** Audio tours transform plans into guided adventures  
âœ… **Open-Source & Cost-Effective:** No proprietary dependencies, uses free APIs  
âœ… **Efficient & Performant:** Dockerized, ~1-2s response times on modest hardware  
âœ… **Extensible:** Modular design allows easy scaling  
âœ… **Safety-Focused:** Built-in verification and advisories  
âœ… **MVP-Ready:** Fully functional with sample data

## Current Limitations

While the API is a complete MVP, some features are simplified for scope and open-source constraints:

- **Real Bookings:** Currently mocks with OpenTripMap data (no actual transactions)
- **Advanced Social Features:** No user invites or group preference resolution
- **Post-Trip Features:** No automated trip diary generation
- **AR Overlays & Offline Caching:** Frontend handles AR rendering
- **Push Notifications:** No Web Push integration
- **Authentication & Security:** No JWT/OAuth (endpoints are open)
- **Scalability:** Single-instance Docker, no load balancing
- **Audio Quality:** Basic TTS (may sound robotic)

> These are intentional MVP limitationsâ€”focus on core planning/replanning/audioâ€”while providing hooks for extension.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker:** For easy deployment
- **Qdrant:** Vector DB (`docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant`)
- **Hugging Face Token:** Get a read token from [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
- **OpenTripMap API Key:** (Optional) Free at [opentripmap.com](https://opentripmap.com)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd smart-travel-api
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill:
```env
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
HF_TOKEN=hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
OPEN_TRIPMAP_API_KEY=your_key  # Optional
```

### 3. Populate Qdrant Database
```bash
python database/init_qdrant.py
```
This scrapes ~500 POIs and embeds them (takes ~5-10 minutes first time).

### 4. Run the API

#### Via Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker build -t smart-travel .
docker run -p 8000:80 --env-file .env smart-travel
```

#### Locally (Development)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
